# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the React entry point (`main.jsx`), the root component (`App.jsx`), and shared styles (`App.css`, `index.css`). Keep new components in subfolders under `src/` and export them through clear index files when they grow.
- `public/` holds static assets that Vite copies verbatim; store favicons or manifest files here.
- `dist/` is generated by `npm run build` and should remain untracked for edits.
- `vite.config.js` centralizes Vite and plugin settings; adjust aliases or env-driven tweaks there.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies; run after pulling changes affecting `package.json` or `package-lock.json`.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot module reload.
- `npm run build` produces a production build in `dist/`; use it to validate release readiness.
- `npm run preview` serves the production bundle locally for final smoke testing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use modern ES modules, functional React components, and 2-space indentation as shown in `src/App.jsx`.
- Prefer single quotes for imports and strings, and keep JSX attributes in double quotes.
- Name React components with PascalCase (`TrailMapHeader`), hooks with `use` prefixes, and CSS classes in kebab-case.
- Keep styles scoped via component-level CSS files; remove unused selectors during refactors.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated testing is not yet configured; plan to adopt Vitest + Testing Library for unit coverage using the pattern `ComponentName.test.jsx` under `src/`.
- Until tests exist, exercise critical flows with `npm run preview` before pushing to `main`.
- Document manual test notes in PR descriptions so knowledge persists.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the current history: concise, imperative summaries ("Add hero section"), optionally referencing issues (`#12`).
- Squash related changes before opening a PR and ensure `npm run build` passes locally.
- PRs should describe the change, note testing performed, and highlight any user-facing impact or deployment considerations (GitHub Pages auto-builds on `main`).

## Deployment Notes
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds on every push to `main`. Use topic branches for work-in-progress to avoid unintended deployments.
